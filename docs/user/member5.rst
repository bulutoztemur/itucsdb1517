For the all entities, search operation can be done with the search box at the top of the tables.

**For admin users**, there is an admin panel that provides an admin operations such as insert, update, and delete for all entities. This panel also includes a button that initializes the database and inserts a several records for the beginning.

These properties are same for hand and season entities:

   .. figure:: admin_hand.png
      :scale: 80 %

      Operations for Hand section

   .. figure:: admin_season.png
      :scale: 80 %
      :alt: map to buried treasure

      Operations for Season section

In this project delete operations are restricted for the foreign keys that are using by another entities. To illustrate, "left hand" can not be deleted from the database since there are players exist who use left hand.

Similiarly, an update operation cascades all referenced objects in the database.
