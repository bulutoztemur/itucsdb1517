Users can do search and sorting operations on table. They can search using search boxes, and sort clicking any column name that they want to sort. Also, users can choose how many players can be seen in one page, and they can pass next or previous page using links below table. In case of that page is opened late, paging method is used.

**For admin users**, there is an admin panel on the menu. It can only be seen by the users that have admin priviliges. With this interface, administrators can manipulate the database as they like. They can add, update and delete items to the entities as long as they do not cause inconsistency.
